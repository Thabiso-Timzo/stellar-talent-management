            <p>
              Our focal aim is to equip young individuals with the necessary skills 
              that will prune them in becoming the hope of South Africa. 
              We want to turn campaigns into successes and this can only be possible 
              if we use young people whoâ€™ve never been given the opportunity to shine 
              in any spectrum of life. We want young people to fulfil their potential, 
              recognise their self-worth and find their place in the world. STM is a 
              powerful organisation, a leading voice to men and women empowerment 
              and a launch-pad to much needed social change.

          <h2><span>VISION</span></h2>
          <p>
            To invest in the future of South African youth in offering 
            skills development training, internships and bursaries towards 
            tertiary level education. 
            <br /><br />
            Education is the mother of successes- Nelson Mandela. Education 
            is of paramount to STM because it is the key to greater opportunities. 
            Our desire is to give an education to as many individuals as possible 
            in order for everyone to have an equal right to success in the same 
            breath provide jobs.
