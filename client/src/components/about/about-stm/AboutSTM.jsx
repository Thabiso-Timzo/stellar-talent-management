                    Star Talent Management projects was established in 2022 by founder, 
                    Kabungane Biyela. It is a youth empowerment organisation that seeks 
                    to help the marginalised youth. A beacon of hope for hopeful young 
                    individuals that desire to see their dreams to fruition and be 
                    the change in society.

                    Kabungane Biyela grew up in Umlazi, a township where there is less 
                    opportunities given to the youth. She then moved to Johannesburg 
                    seeking greener pastures where she entered a beauty pageant called 
                    Miss Masakhane’ and won the title of the first princess. 
                    Her desire to chase her dreams in both the modelling and acting came to pass. 
                    She played a supporting role in a series called ‘Is’phindiselo’ alongside 
                    Baby Cele, Zamani Mbatha, Zikhona Bali and many more which added weight to her 
                    name and profile. Having obtained a Diploma in Media Practices at Boston Media 
                    House in 2021 and a stable career, she felt her achievements stemmed from her desire 
                    to making it in life for her people back home. STM is designed for the youth who 
                    dare to dream big. For individuals that have the urge to change their life, 
                    not succumbing to the pressures of society but rather wants to be the change in 
                    society.
